# 3D Solar System Simulation

This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js. It features the Sun and all 8 planets orbiting around it, with real-time speed control for each planet.

## Features

- 3D scene with the Sun and 8 planets (Mercury to Neptune)
- Realistic lighting and camera setup
- Each planet orbits the Sun at a default speed
- Real-time speed control for each planet using sliders
- Mobile-responsive layout

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Use the sliders at the bottom of the page to adjust the orbital speed of each planet.

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Plain JavaScript for animations and UI controls
- HTML/CSS for layout and styling

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `main.js`: JavaScript file containing Three.js scene setup, planet creation, and animation logic
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling and responsiveness
